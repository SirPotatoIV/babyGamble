// bucketing
// -- total number of guesses
// -- calculate the range: max - min (there may be Math methods for this)
// -- divide range by guesses

// create variables to store each guess category and create a basic shape.
// sum up the total count of sex, eyeColor, and hairColor by category
// put all the weights into a single array
// -- convert each weight guess into a single number
// -- There are 16 ounces in a pound, and add that to the pounds property
// put all the lengths into a single array
// -- calculate how you are bucketing.
// -- calculate totals in each bucket.
// take the weight guess and the length guess and put then in an object as a pair
// -- [{weight: 6.5, length: 22}, {weight: 8.6, length: 19}]
// put all dates into a single array
// -- convert into a date datatype
// -- calculate how you are bucketing.
// -- calculate totals in each bucket.
// put all times into a single array.
// -- calculate how you are bucketing.
// -- calculate totals in each bucket.
